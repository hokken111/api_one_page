The app use the following frameworks and boilerplates:

<ul>
<li><a href="https://handlebarsjs.com/">Handlebars javascript</a></li>
<li><a href="https://materializecss.com/">Materialize css</a></li>
<li><a href="https://jquery.com/">jQuery</a></li>
</ul>

To get started, download the project and open index.html in your browser as well as in a code editor. Study the structure to get an overall picture of how handlebars, jQuery and Materialize work together to show the results from the API queries. 

Use the template to create your own app with an API of your liking or needs.
